# Snakes-and-Ladders
A Java program that generates a board and plays the well-known game of snakes and ladders.

## Boards
At first, the program prints 3 different tables. The first one includes only the snakes in the game, the second one the ladders and the third one the presents.

## Game
After creating the board, the actual game begins. Players roll the dice, and the player with the highest roll starts. A detailed description of each round is provided at the output of the program, end eventually we have an outcome. I should mention that the second player is a "smart" player, he evaluates his moves and every time he choose the most efficient one. So probably he will always be the winner!
